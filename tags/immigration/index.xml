      <description>So hey. Hi.
I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s been a while.
It has been a while.
Probably an idea to restate some things, and to get re-acquainted. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write more comprehensive stories about these things in time, but, y&amp;rsquo;know, since we last met, here&amp;rsquo;s the skinny on what&amp;rsquo;s been happening:
 We moved to the US in April 2017 I still work for Microsoft We bought a house We got a dog (Elmo) We had a baby (Stanley Bear) We have permanent residence (Green Card) status now  That last one is actually particularly important.</description>
