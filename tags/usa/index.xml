      <description>Welcome back to my Very British Guide to the US Election, where we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about the machinations of the race for the White House. If you&amp;rsquo;ve missed them, catch parts 1 and 2.
 Today&amp;rsquo;s the day of the Nevada Caucuses, and will be a make-or-break day for some of the remaining candidates. Chief amongst those is probably former Vice-President, Joe Biden. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Joe.
Joe&amp;rsquo;s campaign is not where his advisors and pundits thought it would be at this early stage.</description>

      <description>This is Part 2 of my Very British Guide to the US Election. If you missed Part 1, find it here.
 So, now that we&amp;rsquo;ve covered our Civics 101, looking at Congress, the President, voting and the Electoral College, let&amp;rsquo;s start looking at what&amp;rsquo;s actually going to happen this year.
 Donald Trump vs. ?? Presidents can only serve a maximum of two consecutive terms of 4 years, for a total of 8 years.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s officially Election season in the US. I mean, for reals. It feels like it has been looming, ominously, on the horizon here, like a unavoidable future task that will definitely demand your attention - like a tax return, or a leaky roof.
And, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of felt like this since the day of the infamous &amp;ldquo;yuge&amp;rdquo; inauguration, and the rumbling, lengthy sagas of the Robert Mueller report1 and the Impeachment trial2 were just mere distractions before the real task at hand.</description>

      <description>So hey. Hi.
I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s been a while.
It has been a while.
Probably an idea to restate some things, and to get re-acquainted. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write more comprehensive stories about these things in time, but, y&amp;rsquo;know, since we last met, here&amp;rsquo;s the skinny on what&amp;rsquo;s been happening:
 We moved to the US in April 2017 I still work for Microsoft We bought a house We got a dog (Elmo) We had a baby (Stanley Bear) We have permanent residence (Green Card) status now  That last one is actually particularly important.</description>
