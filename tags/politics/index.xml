      <description>I want to prefix this long diatribe with the disclaimers that I am not an expert on politics, I am not an economist, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even a particularly smart person. For reals.
This will be my second ever political blog posting. I&amp;rsquo;m almost ashamed of myself for doing it. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. I&amp;rsquo;ve just never felt so compelled to write about things like this before - I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the losing side of every major election I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to vote in and I&amp;rsquo;ve brushed it off with a sigh and just, y&amp;rsquo;know&amp;hellip; got on.</description>
