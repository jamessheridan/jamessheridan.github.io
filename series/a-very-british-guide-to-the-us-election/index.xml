      <description>Welcome back to my Very British Guide to the US Election, where we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about the machinations of the race for the White House. If you&amp;rsquo;ve missed them, catch parts 1 and 2.
 Today&amp;rsquo;s the day of the Nevada Caucuses, and will be a make-or-break day for some of the remaining candidates. Chief amongst those is probably former Vice-President, Joe Biden. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Joe.

 Donald Trump vs. ?? Presidents can only serve a maximum of two consecutive terms of 4 years, for a total of 8 years.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s officially Election season in the US. I mean, for reals. It feels like it has been looming, ominously, on the horizon here, like a unavoidable future task that will definitely demand your attention - like a tax return, or a leaky roof.
And, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of felt like this since the day of the infamous &amp;ldquo;yuge&amp;rdquo; inauguration, and the rumbling, lengthy sagas of the Robert Mueller report1 and the Impeachment trial2 were just mere distractions before the real task at hand.</description>
